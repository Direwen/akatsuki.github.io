	<p>Rogue Ninja of The Hidden Rain Village, Amegakure. Pain is actually a team of six corpses animated and controlled by a seventh and true "Pain", Nagato. Thy share a set of violet eyes with concentric ripple patter called Rinnegan. The user is said to be capable of using all five elements. Legend says the user will be one to usher in great change.Blessed with the legendary Rinnegan that Madara spent decades creating, Nagato took on the name Pain when he turned the Akatsuki into a villainous organization. With the goal of ruling over mankind as a means be the focus of the world’s hatred, he used his Rinnegan to control six corpses that each had unique abilities.

On top of mastering each elemental transformation, Nagato could also destroy entire cities instantly by creating a massive force. He literally possessed the might of an entire army and was only stopped by Naruto’s use of Sage Mode and the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox’s chakra. Nagato was able to command the strongest iteration of the Akatsuki because he was strong than most of them.</p>

	<p>Pain's partner and friend. rogue Kunoichi of the Hidden Rain. Skilled with origami. Her Ninjutsu mostly manifests as thousands of foldable paper that she controls at will.A founding member of the Akatsuki, the only woman in the organization’s second generation, and the advisor to the second generation’s leader, Pain, Konan is an exceptionally strong and cautious ninja. Uniquely, she can channel her chakra into paper for a variety of creative attacks, and she can even transform her body into various pieces of paper to move quickly and avoid harm.

With enough time to prepare, she’s even able to push Tobi to his very limit, by controlling enough explosive paper to attack the masked ninja nonstop for ten minutes. With the versatility, mobility, and sheer destructive power of her techniques, Konan is an incredibly powerful ninja and one of Jiraiya's strongest pupils.  </p>

	<p><span>
Zetsu's possible subordinate who wishes to fill in Sasori's position now that he is dead. When he found Sasori's ring, he thought he could now be a member of Akatsuki. However, Zetsu scolded him for this, saying it wasn't that easy to join Akatsuki. Tobi has a very formal, correct manner of speech. He possibly refers to himself in the third person, saying "Tobi is a good child" (it is not specified whether this line is spoken by Tobi or Zetsu). Tobi finds Deidara's other arm, but Deidara tells him to drop it. After being scolded by Deidara 3 times, Deidara jokingly strangles Tobi with his feet.
Some fans theorize that Tobi is actually (the deceased) Uchiha Obito, due to his odd one-eyed mask, short hair, clumsiness, name similarity, and uncanny humor.
Miscellaneous Information
- In addition to these named members, there are three more Akatsuki yet to be identified.
- Akatsuki means "Dawn" in Japanese.
- Each Akatsuki member wears a ring, inscribed with the first kanji related to the nine mythical beasts in Japanese mythology, including the four Kyoto guardian gods (shijin). They are:
Seiryū - Green/blue Dragon
Byakko - White Tiger
Suzaku - Phoenix (literally "Red Sparrow")
Genbu - Tortoise (literally "Mysterious Warrior")
Kūchin - The Void
Nanjū - Southern Star
Hokuto - Northern Star
Santai - The Three Levels
Gyokunyō - The Virgin
- The group has a jutsu similar to Orochimaru's Kuchiyose: Edo Tensei (Summoning: Impure World Resurrection) named Shōten no Jutsu (Shapeshifting Technique) which allows a member to replace someone else's body with his own likeness, complete with his jutsu, chakra level, and other abilities, and control it to fight on Akatsuki's behalf.
- There has been a brief mention in the manga about how each Akatsuki member seems to have been assigned one, and only one, bijuu to hunt down and capture, and indeed there is (or was) one Akatsuki member for each bijuu.</p>

Noted within the Wanted Book, Uchiha Itachi is an S-Level criminal and a Konoha Missing-nin. He graduated top of his Academy class at age 7, had mastered the Sharingan by age 8, became a Chūnin at 10 and was previously a Black Ops (ANBU in the Japanese versions) captain at the age of only 13. At 18, he was even feared by Orochimaru. He left Konoha some years ago, after killing his whole clan except for Uchiha Sasuke, his brother. He is currently associated with Akatsuki. Orochimaru had planed to use Itachi's body as a new container, but seeing as Itachi is powerful to such a degree that even Orochimaru fears him, it's easy to see why Orochimaru decided to leave Akatsuki and try his luck with Sasuke instead.
The reason Itachi killed his clan, and the reason he left Sasuke alive only to physically and mentally abuse him, still remains a mystery. When asked why by Sasuke, he replied "To see what I am capable of." He was until recently the sole person who possessed the Mangekyō Sharingan as revealed in the manga. Hatake Kakashi has somehow developed a new kind of Mangekyō Sharingan in the manga. Kakashi's Mangekyō Sharingan appears different compared to Itachi's, and the similarity in power of both Mangekyō Sharingan is still unknown.
Itachi has told Sasuke that if Sasuke were to obtain the Mangekyō Sharingan, the people able to use it will total at three. It is unknown whom the third person Itachi is referring to.
Trivia
- The name "Itachi" means "Weasel" (Note that in Japanese mythology, weasels are a bad omen, signifying bad luck and deaths).
- While it is generally agreed on by fans that Uchiha Itachi became an ANBU captain and massacred his clan at age 13, quite a few of them seem to be confused about when he graduated from the academy, mastered the Sharingan, and became Chūnin. The events are often misinterpreted as having happened one or two years earlier than they did.</p>

Age: 314<br><br>

Hoshigaki Kisame, along with Uchiha Itachi attempted to kidnap Uzumaki Naruto for Akatsuki purposes several years ago, but were effectively thwarted by Jiraiya. Itachi later explained that it isn't time to kidnap Naruto yet. Kisame and his sword (Samehada, "Shark skin") both have shark-like characteristics. The sword also has the ability to drain chakra.
Kisame comes from Kirigakure. He is known as the Mysterious Person of the Hidden Mist (Kirigakure no Kaijin). He is also part of the Kiri no Shinobigatana Nanajin Shu ( "Seven Swordsmen of the Mist"), as was Momochi Zabuza, presumably a group of seven Mist ninja famed for their usage of oversized swords.
Kisame's chakra is apparently considered very large, even by the Akatsuki's standards. Their leader even comments on his large amount of chakra.
Trivia
- Kisame means demon shark, probably a reference to his tall height and appearance.
- Hoshigaki means dried persimmon.
- Kisame's shark-like appearance and sword Samehada are rumored by fans to have been related to the Three-Tailed Shark in Japanese legend known as Isunade and his subordinate Samehada.</p>

	<p><span>Name: Zetsu<br><br>
Ring: (Kai, boar)<br><br>
Position: Right little finger<br><br>
Partner: None<br><br>
Affiliation: Akatsuki, Nukenin (Missing-nin) from Kusagakure (Hidden Grass)<br><br>
Signature Ability: Spying jutsu</span><br><br>
Not much is known about this mysterious character at the moment, only that he is Akatsuki's spy. His head appears to be enveloped in a large Venus flytrap. The right side of his face, and likely his body, is black in color while his left side is white in color. His pupil-less eyes and superior vision suggest that he may harbor something similar to Byakugan. His first appearance was after the Naruto and Sasuke fight at the end of Part 1, which he observed in secret. He was also responsible for warning Akatsuki of the positions of the approaching Team Kakashi and Team Gai during their extraction of Gaara's bijū. He has the ability to merge with trees and other plants. He is a missing-nin from Kusagakure no Sato (Hidden Grass Village).
He seems to have a split personality, as the white half of his face speaks only in Katakana, which could indicate a robotic voice , while the black side uses both Kanji and Kana. He is also a cannibal (in Ch 261, he ate Kisame's body substitute), which fits his "venus flytrap" body.
Trivia
- Zetsu's ring has the kanji (Kai, boar) while the list of Akatsuki rings suggests he should have the kanji (Gen, mysteriousness). The two kanji are somewhat similar in appearance though, which suggests an error by either the artist or the reader/translator.</p>

	<center class="bomb"> "Deidara" </center>

	<p>One of the flashiest members of the Akatsuki, Deidara is an explosives expert who specializes in widespread destruction. Combining earth and lighting elements to uses explosion techniques, Deidara uses the various mouths on his body to turn ordinary clay into moving explosives he controls with his chakra.

This makes him one of the most versatile members of the Akatsuki, and he is able to defeat anyone who doesn’t possess an absurd level of speed or defense. His only notable weaknesses are lighting attacks neutralizing his explosive clay and his own shortsightedness. He is one of the strongest ninjas in the entirety of Naruto and it took every bit of Sasuke's cunning and skill to defeat him when they fought.       </p>

	<center class="bomb"> "Sasori" </center>

	<p>Sasori is the greatest puppet master ninja in Naruto and is nearly immortal as well. He can summon an army of upwards of a hundred puppets made from humans that all retain their abilities, as well as numerous hidden weapons. Having transformed his own body into a puppet, Sasori is also immune to all manner of poisons and doesn’t take any actual damage from attacks that don’t strike his flesh core.

However, most of Sasori’s fierceness in battle comes from catching his opponents off guard with his many hidden attacks and abilities. If someone knows about his secret puppet body and puppet arsenal, he becomes much less of a threat and is easier to defeat with enough raw power or by exploiting the weaknesses of his puppets.     </p>

<div >
	<center class="damn"> "Kakuzu" </center>

	<p>Kakuzu is another near immortal and monstrous member of the Akatsuki. He possesses the ability to use each element of chakra to the fullest potential and his entire body is composed of tendrils that he can use like threads. This lets him not only control anything he inserts the threads into but also recover from fatal injuries by replacing his damaged organs with another’s instantly.

Only by damaging Kakuzu’s entire body simultaneously and destroying all of the organs he has in reserve can this ageless ninja be defeated. Considering that he has enough physical strength to take on a Tailed Beast, that’s an exceptionally tall order that only a few talented ninjas in Naruto are able to fill.

	<center class="damn"> "Hidan" </center>

	<p>Hidan isn’t so much a powerful ninja, as he is a durable one. He really only has two tricks, his exceptional immortality and a technique that turns him into a voodoo doll that harms anyone who attacks him so long as he’s within a special symbol.

This makes the cultist ninja a challenging opponent to defeat, but rather easy to incapacitate if an enemy knows about his two abilities. In fact, Shikamaru Nara is able to defeat Hidan rather easily by preventing him from drawing his damage transfer symbol and breaking up his limbs so he cannot attack. Sure, it might be difficult to defeat Hidan without proper research, but even a little bit of planning is enough to best this immortal ninja.

	<center class="damn"> "Juzo Biwa" </center>

	<p>As the single anime-only member of the second generation of Akatsuki, Jūzō Biwa has some impressive abilities while not quite matching up to any of his canonical peers. He utilizes water techniques to surprise foes and then strikes them down with the iconic Kubikiribōchō blade.

He also possesses enough physical strength to wield the giant sword with ease and was respected enough to partner up with the incredibly strong Itachi Uchiha on a mission to take on the Fourth Mizukage. However, his skill set seems to make him little more than a discount Zabuza, and it seems like he’s quite a bit weaker than any of his contemporaries. All in all, he wasn’t much of a boost to the organization.

	<center class="damn"> "Shin uchiha" </center>

	<p>Shin Uchiha isn’t technically a member of the Akatsuki or an Uchiha for that matter, but he’s still an absolute powerhouse of an opponent. Taking on the name Uchiha after developing a fascination with the nearly extinct clan, he tries to revive the Akatsuki during Boruto: Naruto Next Generations because he believes violence will further human evolution.

He possesses numerous Sharingan eyes implanted all throughout his body and a unique trait that prevents his body from rejecting implanted organs. His Sharingan allows him to control anything he places a special seal on with telekinesis, and his clone army gives him plenty of manpower and spare body parts. It’s no surprise that it took both Sakura and Sasuke’s efforts to defeat this ninja.
